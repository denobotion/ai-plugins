# Bitwarden Software Engineer Plugin

## Overview

Software engineer agent for a Bitwarden product team. Generic AI coding assistance doesn't know our zero-knowledge constraints, multi-client reality, dual-ORM strategy, Angular/RxJs conventions, or the verification commands we actually run before declaring work done — let alone the canonical Bitwarden "Software Engineer" role on the [Engineering Career Ladder](https://bitwarden.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EN/pages/1027899486/Engineering+Ladder) that frames what the role is evaluated on. This plugin grounds the agent in that role: implementing stories, tasks, and bugs in the team's domain with code quality, performance, and security in mind, communicating clearly, and following our Git conventions.

## Agent

## Cross-Plugin Integration

| Plugin                        | How It's Used                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bitwarden-delivery-tools`    | `committing-changes`, `creating-pull-request`, `perform-preflight`, `labeling-changes` for the day-to-day PR loop                       |
| `bitwarden-atlassian-tools`   | `researching-jira-issues` when picking up a story                                                                                       |
| `bitwarden-security-engineer` | `reviewing-security-architecture`, `analyzing-code-security`, `reviewing-dependencies`, `detecting-secrets` when relevant to the change |

Per-repo skills (`implementing-dapper-queries`, `implementing-ef-core`, `writing-database-queries`, and similar) live in the relevant Bitwarden repos and are picked up by Claude Code's progressive disclosure.
