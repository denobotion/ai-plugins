  Prepare a Bitwarden design handoff — the Confluence handoff page, the Figma "Ready for Dev"
  state, and the Jira transitions that go with them. This skill should be used when the user
  asks to "prep handoff", "create a handoff page", "what goes in a handoff", "hand this off to
  engineering", "move this to Ready for Dev", or any task at the end of the In Design phase
  before engineering picks the work up. Composes `navigating-design-jira-process` for the
  Jira moves and `using-figma` for verifying the Figma file is handoff-ready.

# Preparing a Design Handoff

This skill grounds handoff prep in Bitwarden's actual handoff page template — the same
structure every recent project handoff page in the Product and Design Confluence space
follows. Engineering relies on that consistency. A handoff missing a section creates downstream
questions and slows the epic into development.

When prepping a real handoff, read at least one recent handoff page from the same engineering
area first via `get_confluence_page` (the Bulk Management handoff is a clean reference point,
ID `387350548`). The full template, with every field's purpose, lives in
`references/handoff-template.md`.

## The handoff is three things, not one

A handoff is finished when all three are in place:

1. **The handoff Confluence page.** Created in the Product and Design space, structured per
   the template. This is the document engineering reads first.
2. **The Figma file in Ready-for-Dev state.** Final designs grouped on a single page, with
   sections named to match the engineering stories that will consume them. Sections marked
   "Ready for Dev" in Figma. Annotated prototype available.
3. **The Jira state aligned.** Design tasks moved to DONE on the design board, the engineering
   epic moved to TODO / READY FOR DEV, and the Figma file linked in the epic's "Design"
   section. The full Jira choreography is in `navigating-design-jira-process`.

If any of the three is missing, the handoff isn't done — even if the page exists.

## Prep checklist (before writing the page)

- The product initiative or PRD page exists and is current.
- The engineering epic exists in Jira and the designer is or has been assigned to it.
- Designs have been through critique at 30%, 60%, and 90% and the 90% review has been
  addressed.
- Real-user testing has happened where applicable (this is what 90% is for).
- The Figma file's final-designs page is curated — no scratch pages, no unused frames in the
  Ready-for-Dev surface.

If any item is missing, surface that before drafting the page — handoff is not the moment to
discover the 90% review never happened.

## The template, at the section level

(See `references/handoff-template.md` for each field's purpose, expected content, and the
common gotchas.)

- **Product Initiative Confluence Page.** Link to the PRD-equivalent.
- **Design Confluence Page.** Self-link (current page).
- **Link to Development Epics.** Engineering epic(s) in Jira.
- **Designer.** The assigned designer (mention the user, don't just type the name).
- **Design Status.** `DESIGN DONE` once handoff is real.
- **Product Initiative.** Repeat the link to the initiative document at the section level.
- **Background.** Brief project purpose, goals, and the solution shape — enough for someone
  picking the epic up cold to understand the _why_.
- **Stakeholders & Team.** Primary and secondary stakeholders.
- **Jira/Asana Tickets.** Epic or story-level links.
- **Design Documents.** Research, source-of-truth design docs, prior design pages.
- **Userflows.** Happy path and edge cases.
- **Message Text File.** A table of every toast, notification, form verification, and email
  copy string, numbered to match the Figma frames. This is the single most-skipped field —
  flag it before publishing.
- **Figma Prototype.** Link to the high-fidelity prototype.
- **Annotated Prototype.** Link to the annotated version following Bitwarden's annotation
  process.

## Composing with other skills

- **`using-figma`.** Before publishing the handoff, use `get_metadata` to confirm the
  Ready-for-Dev sections exist with the expected names; use `get_variable_defs` to confirm
  tokens are library-bound rather than raw values; use `search_design_system` if a component
  in the design is suspiciously close to one that already exists.
- **`navigating-design-jira-process`.** The Jira moves that go with handoff are documented
  there — assigned epic to TODO, design tasks to DONE, dev-support task created, designs
  linked to engineering stories, "Ready for Dev" marks applied to Figma sections.
- **`content-style-guide`.** Walk the Message Text File table through the style guide before
  publishing. Toasts, errors, and form-verification text are the highest-leverage place to
  catch content-style issues before engineering localizes them.

## Common omissions to catch

- **Missing Message Text File.** Engineering will ask for it the moment they pick the epic up.
  Build the table before publishing.
- **Background that assumes context.** The handoff page is read cold by people who didn't sit
  through critique. Background must stand on its own.
- **Figma file with no Ready-for-Dev marks.** Engineering can't find what's final. The Figma
  side of the handoff is as important as the Confluence side.
- **Sections not aligned to stories.** When engineering creates stories, each story should
  map to a Figma section whose content is _only_ that story. Mismatch creates ambiguity at
  review time.
- **Stakeholder list missing engineering.** Primary stakeholders should include the EM and
  PM. If engineering isn't listed, the handoff hasn't been socialized.

## Output format

When asked to help prep a handoff:

1. **Prep checklist** — what's in place, what's missing.
2. **Page outline** — section-by-section, with what to fill in.
3. **Message Text File draft** — table form, every visible string, numbered to Figma frames.
4. **Figma readiness check** — what to confirm in the file before marking Ready for Dev.
5. **Jira moves** — the specific state transitions to apply, deferring to
   `navigating-design-jira-process` for the choreography.

Always end with the explicit go/no-go: _is this handoff actually ready?_
