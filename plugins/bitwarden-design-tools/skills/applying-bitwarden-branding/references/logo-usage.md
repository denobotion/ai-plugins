# Logo usage

Source of truth: [`bitwarden.com/brand`](https://bitwarden.com/brand). Lockup choice, clear-space rules, and the official SVG come from there.

## Lockups

- **Horizontal lockup — primary.** Per the brand site: _"The primary and preferred composition will be the horizontal lockup."_ Use this unless the available space makes it impossible.
- **Vertical lockup — secondary.** Use only when horizontal won't fit — e.g. narrow sidebars, vertical banners.
- **Product-specific lockups.** Bitwarden products have their own lockups for in-product UI and comparative diagrams. Use these when the artifact is specifically about a single product (e.g. Password Manager, Secrets Manager). These lockups are NOT bundled with this plugin — fetch them from `bitwarden.com/brand`.

## Color variants

The brand site ships two color variants of every lockup:

- **Brand blue (`#175DDC`)** — for use on light surfaces.
- **White (`#FFFFFF`)** — for use on dark surfaces.

Switching between blue and white on the appropriate surface is **not** a recolor. Both ship in the official lockup file. Using blue on a dark surface, or recoloring to any other shade, is.

## Clear space

- **Horizontal logo** — at minimum, leave one shield-width of clear space on every side. Nothing — text, icons, illustration, edge of canvas — encroaches inside that margin.
- **Vertical logo** — at minimum, leave one X-height (the height of the lowercase "x" in the "Bitwarden" wordmark) of clear space on every side.

## Bundled assets

This plugin ships the canonical paths extracted verbatim from the official lockup SVG. Use whichever variant fits the deliverable.

Every derived asset preserves the original path data and coordinate system from the official lockup; only the surrounding `<svg>` wrapper and the `viewBox` crop are local. The shield is the same path at every size — scale it via the consuming page's CSS rather than swapping to a different shield variant.

### When to use which

- **Default to a full lockup** (horizontal preferred, vertical only when horizontal doesn't fit).
- **Use the shield alone** for small chip-scale uses where a full lockup would be illegible — e.g. a 32px header chip, a favicon-adjacent context.
- **Use the wordmark alone** only when the shield is already established elsewhere on the same deliverable (e.g. a long-form document where the header carries the shield and a footer carries the wordmark). The brand site does not prescribe a wordmark-only lockup; this is a pragmatic affordance.

### Tinting from a single asset

If you want a single shield/wordmark asset to flow with the deliverable's surface (light or dark) via CSS, swap the SVG's `fill="#175DDC"` for `fill="currentColor"` in your local copy and set the surrounding element's `color` property. Switching between blue and white this way is canonical; setting `color` to any other value is a recolor and not permitted.

## Do-not list

- **Don't recolor** to anything other than the published blue or white.
- **Don't outline** the logo or wordmark.
- **Don't compress or stretch.** Preserve the aspect ratio.
- **Don't place on busy backgrounds** without a solid panel underneath. The shield must read cleanly.
- **Don't recreate from scratch** when the official SVG is available — your trace will not match the canonical outlines.
- **Don't rotate** or apply effects (drop shadow, glow, gradient overlay).

## Official source

If you ever need a variant this plugin doesn't ship (a product-specific lockup, an alternate composition), fetch directly from `bitwarden.com/brand`. The canonical source URL embedded in this plugin's lockup file is:
