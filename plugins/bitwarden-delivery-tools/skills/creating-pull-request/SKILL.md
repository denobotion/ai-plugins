description: Open a pull request from a branch in a Bitwarden repository — pick the conventional commit type prefix that drives the t: label, fill in the repo's PR template, choose an ai-review label, and confirm a full submission preview before running gh pr create.
when_to_use: Use when the user is ready to open a pull request from a branch — phrasings like "create a PR", "open a PR", "ship a draft", "put it up for review", "ready for review", or "ship it". Also use when drafting a PR title or body, picking the conventional commit type prefix, or choosing the t: or ai-review label for a PR being opened (takes precedence over labeling-changes in PR-creation contexts). Do not use for conceptual questions ("how do PRs work") or managing existing PRs (status, merging, addressing comments).

# Creating a Pull Request

This workflow exists because Bitwarden PRs depend on three signals that are easy to forget and hard to fix after submission:

- the **conventional commit type prefix** in the title (CI reads it to apply the `t:` label),
- the **repo's PR template** (reviewers use its sections to orient),
- the **AI review label** (routes the PR to specific automation).

Missing any one of these is silent — CI won't reject the PR, and the reviewer just becomes confused. So this workflow surfaces each decision step by step and shows a full submission preview before anything is pushed, so slip-ups are caught while they're cheap to fix.

## Workflow

Follow these steps in order. Each one produces information the next step needs, and the preview in Step 5 depends on all of them.

### Step 1 — Confirm preflight is done

A PR opened on broken work wastes reviewer time and tends to mask the real problem under a pile of comment threads. Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to confirm preflight before continuing:

- **Question**: "Has `perform-preflight` already run on this branch?"
- **Options**:
  - `Yes — proceed` — continue to Step 2
  - `No — run it now` — invoke `perform-preflight`, then continue to Step 2 once it passes
  - `Skip preflight` — proceed only if the user explicitly opts out

### Step 2 — Determine change type and propose the title

The title must follow this exact format:

```
[PM-XXXXX] <type>: <short imperative summary>
```

The `<type>:` prefix is what CI scans (lowercased) to assign the `t:` label. Without it, the PR ships with no type label and triage can't filter it. Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/change-type-labels.md` to pick the right keyword.

If the Jira ticket key isn't in the branch name or recent conversation, ask the user. Don't leave `PM-XXXXX` as a placeholder — a real ticket key is required for tracking links to resolve.

**Show the proposed title to the user before continuing.** This is the first chance for them to catch typos, a missing prefix, or the wrong ticket key.

### Step 3 — Read the repo's PR template

Always read `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` from the target repo before drafting the body. Even when you have a body draft in mind, the template's sections are what other reviewers expect to scan. Skipping this is a common failure mode — PRs ship with improvised bodies that miss sections reviewers depend on.

If the template exists:

- use its sections verbatim as the body structure,
- fill each section based on the actual change,
- keep section headers (e.g. `## 🎟️ Tracking`, `## 📔 Objective`) — they're load-bearing for reviewer scanning,
- delete sections that don't apply (Screenshots with no UI change, for example), unless the template comments say to leave them.

If no template exists, fall back to:

```markdown
## 🎟️ Tracking

<!-- Link to the Jira issue or GitHub issue this change comes from. -->

## 📔 Objective

<!-- Describe what this PR accomplishes — what bug, what feature, what refactor. -->

## 📸 Screenshots

<!-- Required for UI changes; delete if not applicable. -->
```

### Step 4 — Ask about the AI review label

Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to ask:

- **Question**: "Would you like to add an AI review label to this PR?"
- **Options**: `ai-review`, `ai-review-vnext`, `No label`

Capture the answer. You'll surface it in Step 5 and pass it on the command line in Step 6.

### Step 5 — Show the full submission preview, then confirm

This is the most important step in this workflow. **Before running any `git push` or `gh pr create`, show the user a single preview block containing every decision made above.** This is the catch-net for failure modes like title typos, missing type prefix, body drifting from the template, or the AI review label getting dropped between Step 4 and submission.

Use this exact format:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════
  PULL REQUEST SUBMISSION PREVIEW
═══════════════════════════════════════
Target repo:    <owner/repo>
Branch:         <branch-name>
Draft:          <Yes / No>
Title:          <full title as it will be submitted>
Type prefix:    <type>  →  will apply  t:<label>
AI review:      <ai-review / ai-review-vnext / No label>

Body:
---
<full body, exactly as it will be submitted>
---
═══════════════════════════════════════
```

Then use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to confirm:

- **Question**: "Submit this PR as previewed?"
- **Options**:
  - `Submit as shown` — proceed to Step 6 with the previewed values
  - `Edit title or body` — apply the requested edit, then redisplay the preview and re-ask
  - `Change ai-review label` — re-run the Step 4 label question, then redisplay the preview and re-ask
  - `Cancel` — stop without pushing or creating the PR

Only continue to Step 6 when the user selects `Submit as shown`. The recap is non-negotiable — some failures (title in the merge commit, label-driven automation routing) are painful to undo once the PR is live, so a visible chance to catch issues at submission time pays for itself many times over.

### Step 6 — Push and create

Push the branch and run `gh pr create` with the confirmed values:

```bash
git push -u origin <branch-name>
gh pr create --draft \
  --title "[PM-XXXXX] <type>: <summary>" \
  --body "<body from template>" \
  --label "<label>"
```

Defaults that hold unless the user said otherwise:

- create as **draft** — only skip `--draft` if the user explicitly asked for a ready-for-review PR,
- include `--label` only if the user picked a label in Step 4 (omit it for "No label"),
- multiple labels can be passed by repeating `--label`.

After `gh pr create` returns, post the PR URL back to the user.

## Common Failure Modes

These are what the Step 5 preview is built to prevent. Recognizing them helps when adjusting the draft mid-workflow:

- **Title with no type prefix** → `[PM-12345] Add autofill for passkeys` ships with no `t:` label. Include `feat:`, `fix:`, etc.
- **Generic body replacing the template** → reviewers expect the template's sections. Read the template even when the body feels obvious.
- **Label answer dropped between Step 4 and Step 6** → the recap surfaces it; if it's missing there, it's about to be missing on the PR.
- **`PM-XXXXX` left as a placeholder** → tracking links won't resolve. Catch in Step 2 or Step 5.

If any of these slip past the preview, recovery is awkward — the title is permanent in the merge commit, and labels feed downstream filtering and automation.
