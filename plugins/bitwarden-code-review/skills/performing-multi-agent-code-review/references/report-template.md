- ♻️ **Refactor** — Code restructuring needed

## Source-Agent Friendly Names

Every finding carries a `source_agent` value (per `finding-shape.md`). Render it on each finding using the friendly label below — it tells the reader which subagent caught the issue, which aids triage and per-agent calibration.

| `source_agent` | Rendered label                |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `architect`    | Architecture agent            |
| `quality`      | Code quality agent            |
| `bug`          | Bug analysis agent            |
| `security`     | Security & logic agent        |
| `validation`   | Validation agent (collateral) |
